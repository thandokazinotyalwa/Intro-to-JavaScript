# Intro-to-JavaScript
JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages.

<h3>JavaScript Functions and Events</h3>
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.
You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
Scripts can be placed in the body, or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.

<h3>External JavaScript Advantages</h3>
Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:
 1.It separates HTML and code
 2.It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
 3.Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

<h3>JavaScript Display Possibilities</h3>
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

JavaScript Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

JavaScript Statements
JavaScript statements are composed of:
Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values
Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals.
Variable values are called Variables.

JavaScript Variables
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

JavaScript Operators
JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:
JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:

JavaScript Expressions
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
The computation is called an evaluation.
For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:
5 * 10

JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.
The let keyword tells the browser to create variables:
The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables:

JavaScript Comments
Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".
Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
